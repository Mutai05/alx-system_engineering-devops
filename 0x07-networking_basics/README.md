The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network functions and protocols. It consists of seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection between devices.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Manages the flow of data frames between devices on the same network.
3. **Network Layer:** Handles routing and forwarding of data packets between different networks.
4. **Transport Layer:** Manages the transport of data segments between devices and ensures reliability (e.g., TCP and UDP).
5. **Session Layer:** Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Deals with data translation, encryption, and compression.
7. **Application Layer:** Provides network services to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

**LAN (Local Area Network):**
- **What it is:** A network that connects devices in a limited geographical area (like a home, office, or school).
- **Typical usage:** Sharing resources, such as printers or files, and enabling communication among devices.
- **Typical geographical size:** Ranges from a small area, like a single building, to a cluster of nearby buildings.

**WAN (Wide Area Network):**
- **What it is:** Spans a large geographical area, connecting LANs across cities or countries.
- **Typical usage:** Interconnecting multiple LANs, providing access to a larger network or the internet.
- **Typical geographical size:** Covers a wide area, like a country or multiple countries.

**The Internet:**
- **What it is:** A global network that connects millions of devices worldwide.
  
**IP Address:**
- **What it is:** An identifier for devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other.
- **Two types:** IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

**Localhost:**
- **What it is:** Refers to the local computer or device itself.
  
**Subnet:**
- **What it is:** A logical subdivision of an IP network, allowing efficient use of IP addresses.
  
**IPv6 Creation:**
- **Why:** To address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide a larger address space.

**TCP/UDP:**
- **Two mainly used data transfer protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

**Difference between TCP and UDP:**
- TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, while UDP focuses on faster transmission without guaranteed delivery or ordering.

**Port:**
- **What it is:** A logical construct for identifying specific processes or services on a computer.
  
**SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers:**
- SSH: Port 22
- HTTP: Port 80
- HTTPS: Port 443

**Tool/protocol to check if a device is connected to a network:**
- **Ping** is commonly used to check the connectivity of a device within a network.
