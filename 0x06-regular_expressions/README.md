Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are used for pattern matching within strings, allowing you to search, match, and manipulate text based on specific criteria.

Here are some common symbols and their meanings in regex:

- `.` (dot): Matches any single character except newline.
- `^` (caret): Matches the start of a string.
- `$` (dollar): Matches the end of a string.
- `*`: Matches the preceding element zero or more times.
- `+`: Matches the preceding element one or more times.
- `?`: Matches the preceding element zero or one time.
- `[ ]`: Matches any single character within the brackets.
- `( )`: Groups patterns together.
- `\`: Escapes a special character, allowing it to be used literally (e.g., `\.` matches a period).

For example:
- `a*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the character 'a'.
- `^start`: Matches 'start' only if it's at the beginning of a string.
- `[abc]`: Matches any single character 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
- `\d`: Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).

Regex can become quite complex as you combine these symbols and use them in various combinations to define intricate patterns.
