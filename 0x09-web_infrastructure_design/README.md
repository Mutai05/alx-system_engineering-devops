A simplified diagram for the web stack and explain the components, system redundancy, and acronyms:

### Web Stack Diagram:

```

#### Components and Their Roles:

1. **User:** The end-users accessing the web application.

2. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
   - **Role:** Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
   - **Explanation:** When a user enters a domain name, the DNS resolves it to the IP address of the load balancer.

3. **Load Balancer:**
   - **Role:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers.
   - **Explanation:** Ensures even load distribution, increases availability, and prevents any single server from being overwhelmed.

4. **Web Servers (Web Server 1, Web Server 2):**
   - **Role:** Hosts the web application, handles HTTP requests, and serves static/dynamic content.
   - **Explanation:** Multiple web servers improve scalability, handle more concurrent users, and provide redundancy in case one server fails.

5. **Application Servers (Application Server 1, Application Server 2):**
   - **Role:** Executes the application logic and processes dynamic content.
   - **Explanation:** These servers handle business logic, user authentication, and other application-specific tasks, distributing the load and increasing fault tolerance.

6. **Database Server:**
   - **Role:** Stores and manages the application's data.
   - **Explanation:** Centralized database storage facilitates data consistency and allows for efficient data retrieval. Redundancy measures such as backups and replication enhance data availability and resilience.

#### System Redundancy:

- **Load Balancer Redundancy:** Deploy multiple load balancers in a high-availability configuration to ensure continuous operation even if one load balancer fails.

- **Web Server Redundancy:** Run multiple identical web servers behind the load balancer. If one server fails, the load balancer directs traffic to healthy servers.

- **Application Server Redundancy:** Deploy multiple application servers to handle user requests. If one server fails, others can continue processing requests.

- **Database Redundancy:** Implement database replication, backups, or clustering to ensure data availability and recoverability in case of a database server failure.

#### Acronyms:

1. **LAMP:**
   - **Definition:** Stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl, representing a popular open-source web development stack.
   - **Explanation:** Describes a set of software components commonly used to build web applications.

2. **SPOF:**
   - **Definition:** Stands for Single Point of Failure.
   - **Explanation:** Identifies a component or system that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail. Redundancy is used to eliminate SPOFs.

3. **QPS:**
   - **Definition:** Stands for Queries Per Second.
   - **Explanation:** Represents the number of queries or requests processed by a system in one second, measuring system performance and capacity.

This diagram and explanation provide a basic understanding of a web infrastructure with redundancy measures to enhance reliability and availability.
