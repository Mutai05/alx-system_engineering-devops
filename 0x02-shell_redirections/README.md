## Introduction

In this directory, you'll find shell scripts that showcase different ways of redirecting input and output in the Bash shell. Shell redirections are essential for managing input and output streams of commands, files, and pipelines.

## Scripts

Here's a list of the scripts available in this directory:

1. [0-hello_world](./0-hello_world) - Prints "Hello, World" followed by a new line to the standard output.

<!-- Add more scripts here as you create them -->

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `0x02-shell_redirections` directory.
2. Make sure the script is executable. If not, run `chmod +x script_name` to give it executable permissions.
3. Run the script using `./script_name`.

For example, to run the `0-hello_world` script:

```bash
./0-hello_world
