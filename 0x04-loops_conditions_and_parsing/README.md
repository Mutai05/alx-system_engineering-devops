Creating SSH keys involves using the `ssh-keygen` command. This command generates a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. You can create SSH keys by running:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This command generates an RSA key pair with 2048 bits and attaches an email address as a comment to the key.

The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash` in a script's shebang line is portability. `#!/usr/bin/env bash` locates the Bash interpreter by searching the PATH environment variable. It ensures the script uses the user's preferred Bash version, even if it's installed in a different location.

Loops in Bash:

- `while` loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
  ```bash
  while [ condition ]; do
      # commands
  done
  ```

- `until` loop: Executes a block of code until a specified condition becomes true.
  ```bash
  until [ condition ]; do
      # commands
  done
  ```

- `for` loop: Iterates over a sequence (numbers, list of items, etc.).
  ```bash
  for item in list; do
      # commands
  done
  ```

Conditional statements:

- `if`, `else`, `elif`: Used for conditional execution of code.
  ```bash
  if [ condition ]; then
      # commands
  elif [ condition ]; then
      # commands
  else
      # commands
  fi
  ```

- `case`: Provides multiple conditional branching based on pattern matching.
  ```bash
  case $variable in
      pattern1)
          # commands
          ;;
      pattern2)
          # commands
          ;;
      *)
          # default case
          ;;
  esac
  ```

The `cut` command is used to extract specific sections from each line of input (from files or standard input) by bytes, characters, or fields.

Comparison operators in Bash:

- Files:
  - `-e filename`: Checks if the file exists.
  - `-f filename`: Checks if the file exists and is a regular file.
  - `-d filename`: Checks if the file exists and is a directory.

- Other comparison operators:
  - `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-ge`, `-le`: Numeric comparison operators.
  - `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `-z`, `-n`: String comparison operators.

These operators are used in conditional statements to compare values or check file attributes.

For instance:
```bash
if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]; then
    # commands
fi

if [ -e "$file" ]; then
    # commands
fi
```

Understanding and using these concepts will allow you to write more complex and conditional scripts in Bash.
