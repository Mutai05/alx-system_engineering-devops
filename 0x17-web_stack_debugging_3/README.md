**Web stack debugging** is a crucial process that developers undertake to identify and fix issues within the multiple layers that constitute the web application stack. From frontend interfaces to backend servers and databases, understanding and mastering web stack debugging is essential for ensuring smooth and error-free user experiences¬≤.

Here are some key aspects of web stack debugging:

1. **Authored versus Deployed Code**:
   - When debugging web applications in Chrome DevTools, you often encounter the compiled and minified version of your code (referred to as **Deployed Code**). However, as an author, you want to debug your original code.
   - Chrome DevTools now allows you to see and debug the **Authored Code**, which closely resembles the source files you wrote. This separation makes debugging more effective and aligns with your development workflow¬π.

2. **‚ÄúJust My Code‚Äù**:
   - In modern web development, you often work with third-party dependencies and frameworks. However, when debugging, you typically want to focus on your own code.
   - Chrome Canary (version 106 and later) introduces a preview feature called **‚ÄúJust My Code‚Äù**. Enabling this feature allows you to filter out third-party code and concentrate solely on your application code during debugging¬π.

3. **Online Debugging**:
   - Online debugging tools, such as **BrowserStack**, provide instant access to browser DevTools. Developers can inspect specific components for desired device-browser combinations, allowing real-world testing and debugging¬≥.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - To effectively debug website issues, consider the following best practices:
     - **Use Console Logging**: Log relevant information to the console during development.
     - **Inspect Network Traffic**: Analyze network requests and responses.
     - **Check Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers and versions.
     - **Use Source Maps**: Utilize source maps to map minified code back to the original source.
     - **Breakpoints and Step Through Code**: Set breakpoints and step through your code to identify issues.
     - **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on performance metrics.
     - **Test on Real Devices**: Use real devices for testing and debugging‚Å¥.

Remember, effective web stack debugging ensures a robust and reliable web experience for users! üöÄ
