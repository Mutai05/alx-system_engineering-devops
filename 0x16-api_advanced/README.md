### How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for:

1. **Start with the Overview**: Begin by reading the API's general overview or introduction. This section typically provides information about the purpose of the API, its authentication methods, rate limiting, and other important details.

2. **Explore Endpoints**: Look for a section in the documentation that lists all available endpoints. Each endpoint typically represents a specific action or resource you can interact with. Read the descriptions of each endpoint to understand what it does and what parameters it accepts.

3. **Understand Request and Response Formats**: Pay attention to the request and response formats specified in the documentation. This includes HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST), request parameters, headers, and the structure of the response data (e.g., JSON, XML).

4. **Check for Authentication Requirements**: Determine whether authentication is required to access certain endpoints. The documentation should specify the authentication method and how to obtain the necessary credentials.

5. **Look for Code Examples**: Many API documentation pages include code examples in various programming languages. These examples can help you understand how to make requests to the API and handle the responses.

6. **Refer to Tutorials and Guides**: Some APIs provide tutorials or guides to help developers get started. These resources often provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for using the API effectively.

### How to use an API with pagination:

1. **Understand Pagination Parameters**: API documentation typically specifies pagination parameters, such as `page` and `limit`, which control the number of results returned per page and the page number to retrieve.

2. **Make Initial Request**: Start by making an initial request to the API endpoint without pagination parameters to retrieve the first page of results.

3. **Parse Response**: Extract the relevant data from the response, including any pagination information provided by the API (e.g., total number of results, next page token).

4. **Iterate Through Pages**: Use the pagination information to construct subsequent requests for additional pages of results. Update the pagination parameters accordingly and make subsequent requests until you have retrieved all desired data.

### How to parse JSON results from an API:

1. **Retrieve JSON Response**: After making a request to the API, you'll receive a JSON-formatted response. Use a library or built-in functionality in your programming language to parse this response into a data structure (e.g., dictionary, list).

2. **Access Data**: Once the JSON response is parsed, you can access the individual elements and values using their keys or indices. Navigate through the JSON structure to extract the specific data you need.

### How to make a recursive API call:

1. **Define Recursive Function**: Write a function that makes an API call and processes the response. This function should also handle pagination if necessary.

2. **Make Initial Call**: Call the recursive function with the appropriate parameters to retrieve the initial set of data.

3. **Process Response**: Parse the response and extract the relevant data. If pagination is involved, determine whether additional calls are needed to retrieve more data.

4. **Recursion**: If additional data is required, make recursive calls to the same function, passing any necessary parameters (e.g., pagination tokens) to retrieve subsequent pages of data.

5. **Base Case**: Define a base case for the recursion to terminate. This could be reaching the end of the data or reaching a specified limit.

### How to sort a dictionary by value:

1. **Convert Dictionary to List of Tuples**: Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary.

2. **Specify Sorting Criteria**: Define a sorting criteria, such as sorting by the dictionary values.

3. **Use Sorted Function**: Use the `sorted()` function, specifying the list of tuples and the sorting criteria (e.g., using a lambda function to access the dictionary values).

4. **Optional: Reverse Sorting Order**: If needed, specify the `reverse=True` parameter to sort in descending order.

5. **Retrieve Sorted Results**: The `sorted()` function returns a new list of tuples sorted according to the specified criteria. You can iterate through this list to access the sorted key-value pairs.

These are general steps, and the specific implementation may vary depending on the programming language you're using and the structure of the API response or dictionary.
